# PythonTicTacToe

This program was created as a practice for my python skills. I spent the majority of my past working in MATlab and this felt like a fun entry into the world of python. I completed this program without very much difficulty, but I would like to recreate it at some point with classes and objects as that is the strength of python. For now, this is what I have. Code is fully functioning. Computer program is random so it would be pretty embarrissing if you lose. Have fun!
